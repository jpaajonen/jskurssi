Description:

Project 1 is a simple table-based To-do list where you can:

- add tasks
- strike out tasks
- remove tasks.

The list gives out an alert if the task is empty/too short.

Self evaluation:

- The application uses only native Javascript.
- The application uses DOM scripting.
- The source coding is publised in Github.
- The application has been published in Netlify.
- The application utilizes buttons and checkboxes.

Apart from saving the information in the browser, the requirements are met.

Unfortunately I ran out of time before I could come to grips with local storage.
I managed to push the list items into local storage in an array form and manipulate the stored data (i.e. remove deleted tasks from the array)
but did not manage to iterate them into the table when reloading the app.

Taking all this into consideration, I'd evaluate the project as satisfactory.
